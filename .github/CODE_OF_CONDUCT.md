- Be Inclusive: Encourage participation from people of diverse backgrounds and experiences.
- Communicate Clearly: Use clear and professional language in all communications, whether they are in comments, issues, or discussions.

## Enforcement

Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in a range of responses, from a warning to temporary or permanent removal from the project. The severity of the response will be proportional to the nature of the violation.

The project maintainers will handle enforcement with discretion and transparency. Our goal is to address issues fairly and ensure a positive experience for everyone involved.
